# Music Playlist Manager App - An app that allows users to create and manage their song playlists

## Project Overview

The Music Playlist Manager App is an app that allows users to store song details entered by the user, and allows them to create and manage their own playlists.
This app allows users to rate songs from a rating of 1 - 5, the user can add comments to these songs stating the genre of music the song belongs to or how the song makes the user feel when listening to it.
The user can also enter their own details about the artist like the name of the artist. This app caters for the user adding up to four songs to their playlist.
